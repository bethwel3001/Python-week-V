# OOP Python Assignments 🐍✨

## Assignment 1: Superhero Factory 🦸‍♂️

**Concepts Demonstrated**:  
- Class creation & object initialization  
- Encapsulation (private/protected members)  
- Inheritance & polymorphism  
- Random generation & user interaction  

**How to Run**:  
```bash
python class_design.py
```
**Features:**

- ✅ Team formation with combined power levels
- ✅ Fun catchphrases and emoji visuals


## Assignment 2: Polymorphism Zoo & Vehicles 🐾🚗
**Concepts Demonstrated:**

- Polymorphism through move() method
- Abstract base classes
- User interaction & randomization
- Animated console output

**How to Run**:  
```bash
python polymorphism_design.py
```
**Features:**
- ✅ Animal and vehicle movement showcase
- ✅ Interactive entity creation
- ✅ Educational facts with humor
- ✅ Three display modes (animals/vehicles/interactive)

**Common Requirements Met:**
- ✔️ Clean class hierarchies
- ✔️ Interactive user input
- ✔️ Demonstrates OOP pillars (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
- ✔️ Playful implementation with technical rigor
